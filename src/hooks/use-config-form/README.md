# use-config-form

A wrapper for `form` that does the following:

- saves values on...
  - enter
  - blur
- supports an undo stack
- reverts inputs when they are invalid, ensuring that they are always valid

### Usage

These inputs are used in the top-level Configuration forms so that
the values submitted to the calculation are always accurate.
